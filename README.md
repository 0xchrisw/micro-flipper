# Micro Flipper
My Flipper Zero SD Card Tools & Layout

## Getting Started
Format your micro sd card as FAT32 and label it `FLIPPER`; this will make it easier to find in your file manager. After formatting, insert the card into your Flipper Zero and power it on.

We will be using the [Unleashed](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) firmware for this project.

Plug your Flipper Zero into your computer and open the [releases](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/releases/tag/unlshd-054) page. Next `ctrl + f` "Install via Web Updater". Click the link and follow the instructions to install the firmware. **Note**, *Firefox will not work for this, you must use Chrome or Chromium.*

At this point you can confirm the prompts and turn off the Flipper Zero; if you are highspeed you can also unmount it via the settings menu. Remove the micro sd card and plug it into your computer.

Next `cd` into the root directory of the micro sd card and run `git pull https://github.com/christopherwoodall/micro-flipper`. This will download the latest version of the repository.
